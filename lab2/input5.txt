Last night I waved goodbye now it seems years
I'm back in the city where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you bringing us near
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again
Time in New England took me away to long rocky beaches you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again
I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out all the love that I have
With you there's a heaven
So earth ain't so bad
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again again
