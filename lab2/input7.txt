Have you seen her?
So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree
Ooh, baby, baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way
Ooh, baby, baby
(Ah, come on!) Take a chance you're old enough to
Dance the night away (dance)
Whoa, come on girl, dance the night away (ah)
A live wire, barely a beginner
But just watch that lady go
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than uh
Anything else she knows
Ooh, baby, baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way
Ooh, baby, baby
Well, don't skip romance 'cause you're old enough to
Dance the night away (dance)
Whoa, come on girl, dance the night away (ah)
Oh, yeah
Dance the night away (oh baby)
Dance, dance, dance the night away
(Ah, come on, baby) dance the night away (oh, yeah)
Dance, dance, dance the night away (uh, come on baby, baby)
Dance the night away (ooh, yeah)
Dance, dance, dance the night away
