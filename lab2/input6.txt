For you I'd give up all my time
Searching for the perfect rhyme
And this is one that certainly perplexes
For you I would spend all my days
Thinkin up all the crazy ways
I love you even more than I love Texas
You got Bellaire class and Dallas style
Austin soul and a Luckenbach smile
For you I'd trade my truck in for a Lexus
You smell as sweet as the piney woods
I'd marry you if I thought I could
I love you even more than I love Texas
You're the barb on my wire
The spark in my campfire
There's no brighter star in all the multiplexes
I love this state, you know I do
But the best thing in this state is you
I love you even more than I love Texas
Your wit's as sharp as a prickly pear
The sun shines in your golden hair
Your smile hits me right in the solar plexus
Skin as soft as early morning rain
Temper like a gulf coast hurricane
I love you even more than I love Texas
From the Mucky Duck to the Broken Spoke
You know this state like an old cowpoke
You know where all the tastiest Tex-Mex is
You got Mattson on the radio
Playing Robert Earl and Billy Joe
I love you even more than I love Texas
You're the barb on my wire
The spark in my campfire
Let's head out west where nobody can text us
I promise you I'll never cheat
Or you can throw me out in the old mesquite
I love you even more than I love Texas
And if you make me leave this state
I'll groan but I won't hesitate
'Cause I love you even more than I love Texas
